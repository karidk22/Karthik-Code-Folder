# Outline
#### Basic Description of your project/idea
- Recreating Flappy Bird with Java Processing.

#### Additional Details, how you envision it working, important notes to consider, etc...
- Adding a few quirks to the game such as after level 15 background will change and will get faster. 

#### Features we MUST include
- Keyboard and mouse functions, score counter, and random generation of blocks.

#### Feature we would like to include
- Make the game faster after a certain score and change the bird after another certain score. 

#### How will you incoporate each of the following:
**Module 1 - Variables and Output**
- Bird speed, background speed, gravity
- Output should result in a playble game
**Module 2 - Object Orientation and Inputs**
- Keyboard and Mouse functions (Space or click to jump)
- 
**Module 3 - Math, Returns, and/or Constructors**
- Creating functions for how the bird will move and it's speed, backround generation and speed, block generation and speed, etc...
- Passing parameters for functions for bird speed and background speed. 
**Module 4/5 - Conditionals and Loops**
- Conditionals for keyboard, mouse, and game interactions
- Loop to keep the game going until player fails
**Module 6/7 - Arrays OR ArrayLists**
- ArrayLists for Background generation and block generation
- 
**Module 8 - Optional: 2D Arrays**
- A
- 

#### Language, Code, Platform you plan to use?
- Java Processing 

#### Basic idea of split of work? Tasks assigned to each ohter?
- We each build the same amount of functions, will review code if neccessary. Once we are finished building function we will work together to build the game's code.
